# MYTHOS active-target marker (Kimi edition) — tells the auto-journal which program the
# current session is attacking, so actions that DON'T reference a targets/<prog>/ path
# (e.g. raw curl to a live host) still get filed to the right program's JOURNAL.
# Set this once when you start on a target. UNSET it when you stop hunting
# (path-less probes else misfile to a stale target):
#
#   mtarget.sh <program>     # set active target
#   mtarget.sh --clear       # unset (not hunting anymore)
#   mtarget.sh               # show current
